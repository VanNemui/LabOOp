Câu 1: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Pass by value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed to the method. That's why it's called pass by value.
Pass by reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method. That's why it's called pass by reference.
So, Java is always Pass by Value.
Câu 3: After the call of swap (jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Code by Java:
	public static void swap(Object o1, Object o2) {
		Object tmp = o1;
		o1 = o2;
		o2 = tmp;
	}
Tương ứng trong C:
	Void swap(Object * o1, Object * o2){
		Object * tmp = o1;
o1 = o2;
		o2 = tmp;
Because in the swap function o1 and o2 act like pointers in C and are passed-by-value. This function in C doesn't work -> meaningless swap function -> two objects still remain.
MySway function:
public static void MySwap(DigitalVideoDisc dvd1, DigitalVideoDisc dvd2) {
		String temp = dvd1.getTitle();
		dvd1.setTitle(dvd2.getTitle());
		dvd2.setTitle(temp);
	}

After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
